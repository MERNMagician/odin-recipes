    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy, characterized by its
      round, flat base made of dough topped with a variety of ingredients. The
      classic version features a thin or thick crust, smeared with a rich tomato
      sauce, and generously topped with mozzarella cheese. It can be customized
      with an array of toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers,
      olives, and various meats or vegetables. Baked at high temperatures, pizza
      achieves a delightful combination of a crispy crust and melted cheese.
      Whether enjoyed at a pizzeria, made at home, or served at gatherings,
      pizza is a versatile and comforting favorite loved by people of all ages.

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Activate Yeast
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar and yeast. Stir
            gently and let it slit for about 5-10 minutes until becomes frothy
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Dough
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center
            and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir with a wooden
            spoon until a dough starts to form.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the Dough
        <ul>
          Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7
          minutes until smooth and elastic.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let It Rise:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean
            kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for
            about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Step 2:Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>
        Make the Sauce:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add
            minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir well
            and let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes to develop the
            flavors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pizza</h3>
      <li>
        Preheat the Oven:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place
            it in the oven to heat up.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Shape the Dough</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it back to a
          floured surface. Divide it into two portions if you want two pizzas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the dough with a rolling pin or stretch it by hand to your
          desired thickness (about 1/4 inch thick for a classic crust).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add the Sauce</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet lined
          with parchment paper. Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce
          evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add Cheese and Toppings</li>
      <ul>
        Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Add your choice of
        toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, or any
        other favorite ingredients.
      </ul>
    </ol>

      <ul>
    <ol>
        <li style="list-style-t">Bake: </li>
        <li>
          Place the pizza in the preheated oven (on the pizza stone or baking
          sheet) and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden
          brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
      <h3>Step 5:Serve</h3>
      <li>Cool and Slice:</li>
      <ul>
        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes.
        Then, slice it into wedges or squares.
      </ul>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
