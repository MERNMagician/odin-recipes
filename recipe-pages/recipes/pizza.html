    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy, characterized by its
      round, flat base made of dough topped with a variety of ingredients. The
      classic version features a thin or thick crust, smeared with a rich tomato
      sauce, and generously topped with mozzarella cheese. It can be customized
      with an array of toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers,
      olives, and various meats or vegetables. Baked at high temperatures, pizza
      achieves a delightful combination of a crispy crust and melted cheese.
      Whether enjoyed at a pizzeria, made at home, or served at gatherings,
      pizza is a versatile and comforting favorite loved by people of all ages.
