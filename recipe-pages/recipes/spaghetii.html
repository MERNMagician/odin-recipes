    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical pasta that hails from Italy,
      renowned for its versatility and delightful texture. Typically made from
      durum wheat semolina, spaghetti is characterized by its firm yet tender
      bite when cooked al dente. This beloved pasta serves as a canvas for a
      myriad of sauces, from rich and hearty marinara to creamy Alfredo, and can
      be paired with a variety of ingredients, including meats, vegetables, and
      herbs. Often garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and aromatic
      basil, spaghetti is a comforting dish enjoyed by people of all ages,
      making it a staple in households and restaurants worldwide.
