    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat sheets of
      pasta with a variety of fillings. Typically, it consists of alternating
      layers of pasta, a rich meat sauce (often made from ground beef or sausage
      cooked in tomato sauce), and creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce. The dish is
      topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, then baked until golden and
      bubbly. With its hearty layers and blend of savory flavors, lasagna is a
      comforting, satisfying meal perfect for gatherings and family dinners.

      <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

      <li>1/2 tsp salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
    <li>9-12 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a
        combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three
        kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix
        of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
        From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
        noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you
        have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ul>
